# Module_15_Challenge

# Investment Portfolio Bot

---

## Introduction:

The premise of this project is that I have been hired as a digital transformation consultant by one of the most prominent retirement plan providers in the country. They want to increase their client portfolioâ€”especially by engaging young people. Because machine learning and NLP are disrupting finance to improve the customer experience, I decide to create a robo advisor. Both existing and potentially new customers will be able to use this robo advisor to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.

I am defining an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement. I am building and testing the robo advisor, making sure that the bot works and accurately responds during the conversation with the user. I am enhancing the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function, creating an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and integrating it with the bot.

I have created a Jupyter notebook containing my final Lambda function.
